      "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
      "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",

      "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
      "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
      "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",

Chest dips effectively hit the lower region of the pec, similarly to the decline bench press. However, it follows a vertical pressing movement pattern, which provides a unique stimulus for the muscles of the chest. It is best to master the bodyweight variation of this exercise prior to adding weight via weighted vests, belts, or chains. The dip can be performed as part of your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, or full body workouts.",
    "instructions": [
      "Step up on the dip station (if possible) and position your hands with a neutral grip.",
      "Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor.",

      "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Technically there are two ways to perform dips - neither is wrong, just different movement with different purposes: Staying upright and keeping the elbows in close to increase tricep recruitment.",
      "Leaning forward with elbows wider to increase chest recruitment.",
      "If possible, keep the legs straight down while bracing the glutes and abs to limit excessive spinal movement.",
      "If no dip station with steps is available, position a box underneath the handles to boost yourself up to the bars.",
      "If no box is available, then jump into position.",
      "Don’t allow the head to jut forward during the descent.",
      "Ensure the elbows stay just short of lockout to keep tension on the triceps.",
      "Experiment with a false grip by wrapping the thumb over the bar as this may be more comfortable for some."

    "description": "The exercise ball dumbbell bench press is a variation of the dumbbell bench press and an exercise used to build the push muscles of the upper body. The muscles targeted include the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Performing exercises on an exercise ball also provides a core stability challenge as you balance your body and maintain perfect form on the ball. Some implement this training modality on beginners during balance and strength building phases. You can perform exercise ball dumbbell bench press during your chest workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",
    "instructions": [
      "Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on a physioball.",

    "tips": [
      "Maintain more tension through the pecs by not locking out the elbows entirely.",
      "Keep the weights slightly tilted at a 45 degree angle to keep the elbows in a neutral position.",
      "Don’t allow the dumbbells to collide at the top of each rep - bouncing them together may cause you to lose stability within the shoulder and injure yourself.",
      "Squeeze the dumbbells as tight as possible to improve a phenomenon known as “irradiation” which promotes greater shoulder stability.",

Sometimes referred to as the barbell row, the bent over row is a staple movement in most muscle building workouts. Those looking to build muscle utilize the bent over row to target their back, bicep and core muscle. Those in powerlifting and strength circles perform bent over rows to increase their strength on the big 3 movements. The bent over row is typically used to build and strengthen the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius). However, it requires assistance from muscles of the low back, core, and arms to perform a bent over row correctly. There are several variations of the bent over row one can and should perform. Bent over row variations include: Dumbbell Bent Over Row, One Arm Bent Over Dumbbell Row, Reverse Grip Bent Over Row, T-Bar Row, Smith Machine Row. The back is a tricky muscle group to build and strengthen. Sometimes it can help to vary the degree in which you perform the bent over row and well as the hand placement on the bar.

      "Leaning forward happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.",
      "When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.",
      "Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.",

    "description": "The leg press is a variation of the squat and an exercise used to target the muscles of the leg. One can utilize the leg press to target both the quads and the hamstring muscle, depending on which portion of the foot they push through. The leg press is commonly thought of as a machine variation of the barbell back squat. The mechanics are fairly similar, however, the leg press does not completely mimic the movement pattern of the squat. Nor does it work all of the muscle groups that the squat does. The leg press is best used as an accessory movement to the squat, or as a primary movement in gyms which lack the necessary equipment to train the squat movement pattern.",

      "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
      "The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.",

      "Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
      "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
      "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
